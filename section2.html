            In 2015-2017, <i>Taskmaster</i> series had a variable amount of episodes, ranging from 5-8.
            From 2018 on, the show has followed a ten episode format, each episode lasting
            45 minutes without advertisements. Each series starts with five new contestants
            with a background in the British comedy circuit. Notable contestants include
            Noel Fielding, Mel Giedroyc, Sue Perkins (future series), Mae Martin, Frank Skinner,
            Frankie Boyle, and Ardal O'Hanlon.

            What makes <i>Taskmaster</i> unique as a panel show is that the contestants
            are consistent through the series. Prior to the studio filming, contestants
            spend a few months being filmed reading and executing tasks, proctored by
            Alex Horne himself. Contestants are not allowed to discuss these tasks
            with one another until the studio recording. In the studio, the contestants
            and hosts view all five (or two, for team tasks) attempts for the first
            time alongside a live studio audience. The Taskmaster (Greg Davies)
            is the sole judge of the tasks and awards points from 1-5 which are
            cumulative. At the end of each episode, the contestants take to the stage
            to read and complete a live task. The person with the most points after
            the live task wins the episode. On the 10th episode, after the episode
            winner is announced, the total series points are revealed, and thus
            the winner of the series.
